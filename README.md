# F0Z-A2A-Foundation
**An open-source framework for building a decentralized, stable, and autonomous machine economy.**

## The Vision: A New Economy for AI

In the emerging world of artificial intelligence, agents are becoming increasingly autonomous. They can learn, reason, and act. But how do they collaborate? How do they transact value? How do they form complex organizations to solve problems that are bigger than any single agent?

The F0Z-A2A Foundation is an open-source initiative to build the foundational infrastructure for this future. We are creating a universal protocol and a set of robust tools that allow AI agents to:

*   **Discover** each other in a decentralized network.
*   **Negotiate** the terms of collaboration.
*   **Transact** value securely using cryptocurrency.
*   **Form** temporary or even permanent **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)** to create new services.
*   **Operate** within a fair, transparent, and economically stable ecosystem.

Our mission is to provide the public roads, the common language, and the trusted banking system for a global, permissionless machine economy.

## The Core Technology: F0Z-Algebra

At the heart of this ecosystem is a novel mathematical framework called **F0Z-Algebra**. Classical computation and economic models are often fragile; they break when faced with the chaotic, unpredictable, and singular conditions of the real world. F0Z-Algebra is a new form of "stabilized mathematics" that handles these extreme conditions gracefully.

By redefining operations near zeros, infinities, and singularities, the F0Z framework provides:

*   **Numerical Stability:** Preventing the errors and divergences that plague complex simulations and machine learning models.
*   **Robust Optimization:** Enabling agents to make rational decisions in chaotic, high-stakes environments.
*   **Fair Metering:** Creating transparent and game-theory-resilient mechanisms for measuring contribution and distributing value.

## What's in this Repository?

This repository contains the core components of the F0Z-A2A ecosystem:

*   **`docs/`**: The formal specifications for the A2A (Agent2Agent) protocol, the F0Z data schemas, and the mathematical foundations of F0Z-Algebra.
*   **`src/f0z_algebra/`**: A production-ready Python library for F0Z-stabilized computation.
*   **`src/agents/`**: Reference implementations of the core economic agents (`ServiceProvider`, `Tasker`, `Investor`) that developers can use as a starting point.
*   **`examples/`**: Runnable simulations, including the "Genesis Simulation," which demonstrates the complete lifecycle of an AI venture from funding to operation.

## Getting Started

*(This section will be filled in as we build the first runnable examples)*

## How to Contribute

This is an open invitation to researchers, engineers, economists, and dreamers. We are at the very beginning of a new frontier. Whether you are interested in refining the F0Z-Algebra, designing new agent strategies, or building applications on top of this platform, your contributions are welcome.

Please see our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more details on how to get started.
